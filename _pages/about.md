Hi~ I am Songqiang Chen, currently a master student supervised by [Prof. Xiaoyuan Xie](https://xiaoyuanxie.github.io) in the [School of Computer Science](http://cs.whu.edu.cn) and [Centre of Software Testing, Analysis and Reliability (CSTAR Group)](http://cstar.whu.edu.cn) at Wuhan University, China.

My research interests include both *AI4SE* and *SE4AI*. More specifically, I devise deep learning-driven techniques to facilitate intelligent software engineering (for code, document, and linkage processing). Meanwhile, I explore efficient and systematic interesting testing techniques (mainly based on Metamorphic Testing) for intelligent software (e.g., deep learning frameworks, question answering software, autonomous driving systems, translators, etc.), where I particularly value testing efficiency and diversity. 

So far, I have published papers in a few SE/CS top conferences (ESEC/FSE, ASE, etc.) and journals (IEEE TR, IEEE TGRS, etc.). And it was a great honor for me to win an *ACM Distinguished Paper Award* in ASE 2021.

Besides research, I am quite interested in and good at device/software environment setup & maintenance :smile:. And I used to be a contestant of Olympic Information (similar to ACM) and a part-time junior coach of it.
